# CarPage2
After creating CarPage1, I stated that I would create a better looking website taking everything that I have learned. This showcases more information and better design and layout compared to the first. This website showcases used, new, and futuristic vehicles. It ensures what the pros and cons are of buying from each. As of right now, there is no actual text, as it is lorem only. However, all links work in the navbar and footer. The links in the footer direct you to the car company website. The showroom showcases some of the best looking cars that I could find. This will be updated with actual text soon.
